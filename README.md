# Cloud Computing Labs – Semester 6

## Overview
This repository contains the Cloud Computing laboratory assignments completed during Semester 6 as part of the undergraduate curriculum. The labs focus on practical implementation of cloud computing concepts such as application architecture, performance analysis, failure handling, and optimization using modern backend frameworks and tools.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on understanding of how cloud-based applications behave under load and how architectural and code-level decisions impact system performance.

## Labs Included

### Lab 1 – Introduction to Cloud Computing
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Environment setup and initial experimentation

### Lab 2 – Monolithic Architecture
- Developed a FastAPI-based monolithic web application
- Demonstrated single point of failure using intentional crashes
- Identified performance bottlenecks in backend routes
- Optimized `/checkout`, `/events`, and `/my-events` endpoints
- Performed load testing using Locust
- Compared performance metrics before and after optimization

*(Additional labs can be added based on syllabus requirements)*

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- Locust
- HTML (Jinja Templates)

---

## Key Learnings
- Understanding limitations of monolithic architecture
- Impact of inefficient backend logic on performance
- Importance of load testing in cloud applications
- Performance improvement through code optimization
- Practical exposure to backend development and testing tools

---

## Performance Testing
Load testing was performed using Locust to simulate concurrent users and evaluate:
- Response time
- Throughput
- System behavior before and after optimization

Performance improvements were observed after removing inefficient logic and optimizing database queries.

## Notes
- Each lab folder contains the complete implementation for that experiment
- Screenshots and reports are submitted separately as per course guidelines
- This repository is intended for academic and learning purposes only
